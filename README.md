# Fill-up
Fill-up for Hope originated from an idea that my Pastor had.  She wanted to raise money to purchase gas cards for local Cancer patients.  So as a fundraiser we hosted a banquet which we called the Cancer Awareness Banquet where we raffled donated items to raise the money.  The banquet did well and we partnered with the local Cancer institute to distribute the cards. But in order to raise more money the next time, we needed to gain more awareness for the event and more ways to raise money outside of the event.  So, a website was among the ways we decided to do that.  Although, I had used WordPress for the design of my previous website, I had been learning to code for a while and I wanted to try my hand at developing the website from scratch.  I made a visual of the design using Adobe XD and the design was approved.  Then I started working on the website and unfortunately the whole program was scratched due to issues with COVID.  I still work on it from time to time because who knows maybe the program will be resurrected in the future.
